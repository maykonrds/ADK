# ADK Projects, Answers files and scripts.

There are two answer files, both support UEFI. I spent a lot of time looking for and adjusting this, enjoy! The main requirement is Windows ADK 10 ( Win2016) and Windows ADK 8.1 ( Win2012R2).

There are two scripts, please adjust them for your environment. These scripts will be created as a custom .ISO and use autounattend.xml for automated installation of Windows.
