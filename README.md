# ADK Projects, Answers files and scripts.

There are two anwsers files, both are support UEFI.
I spent a lot of time looking for and adjusting this, enjoy!
The main requirement is Windows ADK 10 ( Win2016) and Windows ADK 8.1 ( Win2012R2).

There are two scripts, please ajust for your enviroment.
These script will be created a custom .ISO and will use autounattend.xml for automated installation of Windows.
